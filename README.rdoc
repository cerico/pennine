Scenic is for finding and adding hiking trails. As a non-signed-in user, you're able to browse and search for trails. Once you sign in you're able to rate and favourite trails, as well as mark them as completed. You're also able to add your own trails to the site, and add photos and gpx data to existing trails. Once you've uploaded a trail you become a trailowner, and have admin right over your trails, enabling you to change the location and name of the trail, and edit and delete photos belonging to your trail.
